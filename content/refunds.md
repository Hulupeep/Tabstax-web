- You have not used TabStax extensively (e.g., exported more than 5 Stax or synced across multiple devices).
- You provide a clear reason for dissatisfaction so we can improve our service.

We do not issue refunds for:

- Charges older than 14 days
- Subscription renewals (you may cancel anytime to avoid the next charge)
- Abusive or fraudulent use of the product

## ↩️ Return Process

As TabStax is a digital product, there is no physical return process. Simply contact us for help with your account or request a refund.

To request a refund, email us at: **support@floutlabs.com**  
Please include your account email and the reason for your refund request.

## ❌ Cancelation Policy

You can cancel your subscription anytime from your account settings. Cancelation stops future billing but does **not** trigger a refund unless requested under the refund policy terms.
