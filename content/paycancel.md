# Payment Cancelled
I get it. You're not ready. Maybe you want to play around with it first. No worries. I don't want YOU to pay for something isn't incredibly useful. 

So play around with it. There are LOTS of use cases. 
1. Keeping the process the same across teams. One set of tabs plus process for standups/retros/demos. Eveytone gets the tabstax
2. Content creators. A tabstax with the workflow you recommend and products you are ahem, hawking, all in tabs with instructions. 
Maybe you can even get those sponsors to fork out CASH for a tabstax page with tracking of content. Just spitballing here, bob.
3. Regular ol' context switching. Absolute nightmare ammiright? one of the basic use cases for me but its not tab management its context management.


anyways. you can upgrade to get all the pro benefits when you are 100>% ready.

**To upgrade later:**
1. Click the TabStax extension icon
2. Click "Sync" 
3. Choose your plan
