# About TabStax

Hi, I'm **Colm Byrne** — author of [*Superpowered: How Neurodivergents Win in the Age of AI*](https://mybook.to/superpowered).  
I've worked as a product manager with companies ranging from Apple to early-stage startups and global enterprises.

I built TabStax because I needed it — and chances are, you do too.

## Why TabStax Exists

Modern life demands context switching: work, side projects, research, errands — all in the browser. But tabs weren’t built for focus. Bookmarks are static, messy, and slow.

TabStax helps you instantly load full sets of tabs — we call them **Stax** — grouped by purpose. No more digging. No more mental load.

Whether you're managing ADHD, juggling multiple roles, or just tired of the chaos — TabStax gives you back your flow.

## Who It's For

- Neurodivergent minds (like mine) who crave clarity and fast recall  
- Busy professionals balancing multiple projects  
- Creators, developers, founders, PMs, and researchers  
- Anyone who needs to **switch contexts fast** — without losing momentum
