# Open Your Brain, Not Just Webpages
Pick up where you left off every time with the right context. 

**TabStax** preserves your entire cognitive state — the tabs you had open, what you were thinking, and what comes next. **One click** to switch between projects, clients, or contexts — instantly 100% back where you left off.

## How It Works: One Click Context Switching

### 1️⃣ Save Your Workspace
Click "Create Stax" → All your open tabs are saved as a named workspace with your notes

### 2️⃣ Switch Instantly  
Click any Stax name → **BOOM** — All tabs open, your Start Here! notes appear, you see exactly what to do next

### 3️⃣ Never Lose Context
Each Stax has its own Start Here! page with your thoughts, progress, and next actions. Switch to another project for 10 minutes or 10 days — come back 100% in context.

---

## The 15-Minute Tax You Pay Every Context Switch — Eliminated

### The Problem We All Face

You're deep in Project A, 15 tabs perfectly arranged. Client calls — need to check Project B for "just 5 minutes." You close everything, open Project B tabs, handle the request. Now back to Project A... where were you? What were you thinking? What's next?

**Traditional tools fail because they save pieces, not the whole:**
- Bookmarks save URLs, not your working state
- Task managers save todos, not browser context  
- Note apps save thoughts, not tab configuration

### TabStax Remembers Everything

Every Stax is a **complete workspace** that preserves:

1. **📑 Your Tabs** — Exact browser configuration restored instantly
2. **💭 Your Context** — Project-specific Start Here! notes
3. **⚡ Your Momentum** — Clear next actions for when you return

> "It's like Git for your browser state — every workspace is a preserved moment you can return to instantly."
